# bank-note-authentication-
Banknote forgery is an issue faced by many banking institutions around the globe. This paper reviews our work to build a technique based on machine learning capable of detecting such forgery with high accuracy. We went through various stages for building this technique, starting from downloading the banknote specifications data to building a highly accurate model. Next, we explored various front-end deployment methods so that the model can be used on a larger scale. Finally, we created a user-friendly web-based front-end for our model to accept user input in various ways. We create front end using Flask and deployed using Heroku.
